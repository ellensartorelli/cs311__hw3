1. **Ellen Sartorelli, Joy Wood**
2. **Use TestClassifier.java to run our decision tree from DecisionTree.java that
    uses code from TreeNode.java, Example.java. (Our program does not include an
    extra files besides those initially provided)**
3. **No known bugs.**
4. **Part 2 Discussion:**
  * The decision tree reveals to us that the most effective feature to use while classifying the diagnosis of a potential hepititus patient was varices, enlarged viens in the throat often linked to serious liver diseases. 
  * Positive examples correct: 38 out of 42 - about 90% correct, 4 false negatives
  - Negative examples correct: 7 out of 10 - about 70% correct, 3 false positives
5. **Part 3 Discussion:**
  1. Zoo Data Set
  2. Data from University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository
  3. This dataset describes basic information about animals. The features are binary and are as follow: hair, feathers, milk, airbone, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venom, fins, tail and domestic. We are predicting whether or not an animal lays eggs.
  4. 101 examples in the data set - 50 devoted to training, 51 devoted to testing
  5. 12 features

  * The tree classified the egg-layers off solely whether or not they produce milk.
  * Positive examples correct: 31 out of 32 - about 97% correct, 1 false negatives
  - Negative examples correct: 17 out of 19 - about 90% correct, 2 false positives
